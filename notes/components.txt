Components

- We don't want conditionals in render function, create helper method to take care of logic.

- Must pass in props to constructor and super.

- Must instantiate state in constructor.

- Props are read only

- top down data flow. There should be a single source of truth for any data that changes.

There are class based componenets and non-class based componenets.

We use a constructor with props to instantiate state data.
We also need to write super(props) and bind class Methods.

We set empty state data and then re-render and do data operations in componenetDidMount lifecycle method.

We bind form actions and input actions to custom methods that take care of update and post actions.

We must be wary of the 'this' object and what it is referencing.
